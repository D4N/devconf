    <br/>

    <p>
      Inclusion is a priority for DevConf.US. We are making an effort to be accessible to as many people as want to attend. We are also setting expectations for inclusive behavior through our <a href="https://devconf.info/coc" target="_blank">code of conduct</a> and <a href="https://devconf.info/media-policy" target="_blank">media</a> policies, and are prepared to enforce these.
    </p>

    <p>
      Read on for more information about the inclusion features we are offering and <a href="mailto:info@devconf.us">let us know</a> if there is anything else that would make it possible for you to attend the conference or would make it a better experience for you.
    </p>
