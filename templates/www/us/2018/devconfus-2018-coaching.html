    <p>
        We would like to enable attendees who have not been to many conferences or would like to come up to speed on one of the topics covered at DevConf.us to have a supported experience by being paired up with more experienced attendees. Everyone is encouraged to sign up as either a coach or an apprentice during registration and indicate the track topic based on which they would like to be paired up. Roughly speaking, if you have had three or more years of experience with one of the track topics and have been to five or more conferences, you would make a great coach for the event. If you would like to learn more about one of the conference topics, are interested in career advice, and/or have not attended many conferences in the past, you should consider signing up as an apprentice. We will match people up and will send out mentor / apprentice introductions ahead of the conference.

      One of the rooms on the third floor will be designated as a Coaching Room for exclusive use by people participating in the Coaching Program. The overall time commitment is about 4 hours and it’s the coach’s responsibility to schedule the activities below:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
          Meet in person or via a video call ahead of the conference to exchange introductions, answer any questions the apprentice has as they prepare to attend the conference, learn about apprentice’s career goals, and review the conference schedule together. Plan to attend some talks together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meet on Friday during lunch or at any other convenient time. You can make this time your own, and for example, review the code base for a project of interest and ways to contribute or talk about what the mentor’s work entails and how they deal with challenging situations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do a short check-in meeting on Sunday to discuss takeaways from the conference and any next steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          The coach and the apprentice can stay in touch as desired, but there is no expectation for them to do so.
        </li>
    </ol>
