      We are also setting expectations for inclusive behavior through our
      <a href="https://www.devconf.info/coc.html" target="_blank">code of conduct</a> and
      <a href="https://www.devconf.info/media-policy" target="_blank">media</a> policies,
      and are prepared to enforce these.

      and <a href="mailto:info@devconf.us">let us know</a> if there is anything
      else that would make it possible for you to attend the conference or would

    <br/>

    <p>
    Red Hat is delighted to be able to offer scholarships for attending DevConf.US for new and returning technologists who are interested in learning more about Red Hat technologies and open source.
We particularly encourage to apply people from underrepresented in tech or underprivileged backgrounds, including women, LGBTQ people, Blacks, Latinos, Native Americans, veterans, people with neurological differences, and people with physical disabilities.
Decisions will be made based on applicants’ experience with open source and Red Hat-supported technologies and based on being new or returning to full-time work in technology.
Scholarship amount requests might be taken into account in borderline situations so as to allow us to support more people.
We welcome requests for travel, accommodations, food, child care, and other expenses.
You can request an amount between $100 and $1,500 if you have made significant contributions to a Red Hat-supported technology, and up to $800 otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
    To learn about Red Hat-supported technologies, please see the <a href="http://community.redhat.com/software/" target="_blank">list of projects Red Hat is a contributor to</a> and the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/all-products" target="_blank">list of products Red Hat offers</a>.
We consider contributions that took you over 40 hours significant, and they can include any type of activity that helps an open source project thrive: coding, documentation, design, bug reporting, event organizing, translation, etc.
    </p>
