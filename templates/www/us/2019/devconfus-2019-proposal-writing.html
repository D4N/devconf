      We held two copies of "Writing a Great Talk Proposal," led by Red Hat's <a href="https://twitter.com/fuzzychef">Josh Berkus</a>. 
      If you would like to see the slides you can find them <a href="/files/write-a-great-talk-proposal-for-devconf.pdf">here</a>. 
      We will post a video recording as soon as it is available.
